# PyBer Analysis
## Ride-Sharing Summary by Urban, Suburban and Rural City Types

### Overview/Purpose
  The intent of this analysis was to show the differences in ride-sharing data based on city type by comparing the total weekly fares, including a graphical visualization. 

### Results

  #### Urban
   Overall the data shows that in Urban cities, the number of rides was significantly higher than both other city types. Total number of rides overall for all three cities was 2,375 and total rides in Urban city types was 1,625, nearly 70%. This larger sample size can potentially give the most accurate data analysis due to the increased sample size. Though the Urban cities had a significantly higher number of total rides and total fares, the average fare amounts were lower per ride and per driver than both other city types.  

  #### Suburban
   In Suburban city types there were only 625 total rides, but 490 total drivers. Compared to the Urban city types, this is almost twice the number of drivers per rides. This indicates that there are more drivers operating in the suburban cities, and splitting the total fares among different drivers would imply that there is less money to be made as a driver in a suburban city type, due to competition. 
  
  #### Rural
  In Rural cities there were very few total rides, only 125. When compared to the Suburban & Urban cities this number is significantly lower. However, the per driver average fare is very high in comparison. In Urban cities, the average fare per driver is only $16.57, but in Rural cities the average fare per driver is $55.49.

  #### Weekly Average Fares by City Type
  For the date ranges 01/01/2019-04/28/2019 there was a correlation shown for all three city types. In the first two weeks of the year, all types experienced their lowest total fare amounts. For Rural cities, their lowest grossing was the week ending on 01/13/2019. For both Suburban & Urban types of cities, the lowest fare totals occurred on the week ending on 01/06/2019. There was also a week where all city types experienced a higher than normal total fare amount, the week ending on 02/24/2019. This week was the highest grossing for Suburban city types, and though it's not the max. for Rural or Urban city types, their total fares also increased significantly on this week.

### Summary of Analysis & Recommendation
  Based on the data, it appears that the most lucrative city type per trip and per driver would be the Rural city types. However, there is significantly fewer opportunities (rides) in Rural locations. For steady income, I would recommend driving in the Urban city types. If the PyBer company is looking to increase their revenue within the Urban city types, my suggestion would be charging more per trip. Utilizing 'surge' pricing during the busiest times where there is a higher percentage of drivers, shorter trips, and more rides being given would result in an increased average fare charge per ride and per driver. This would incentivize drivers to participate during peak hours while continuing to drive for shorter overall times and trip lengths since working in the Urban city types has the lowest average fare per driver. The first two weeks of the year have the lowest utilization (based on weekly fare totals) for the date range from 01/01/2019-04/28/2019 for all city types. My business recommendation would be to offer some sort of promo-code or discount to encourage riders to utilize PyBer at the beginning of the year.
